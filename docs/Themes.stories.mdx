# Themes

The **NatDs React Native** is build with theme support at it's heart!

We are currently using the themes available in the package `@naturacosmeticos/natds-styles`.

```
We strongly advise that you also use the themes provided by `@naturacosmeticos/natds-styles`
in the develpment of your application components to easelly provide multi branding and dark
mode support.
```

All the <LinkTo kind="tokens-colors--colors">tokens</LinkTo> listed under the token section are read from this package.

**NatDs React Native does not have its own tokens** as most of the values are compatible with the web.


You can read more about `@naturacosmeticos/natds-styles` on [github](https://github.com/natura-cosmeticos/natds-js/tree/master/packages/styles).
